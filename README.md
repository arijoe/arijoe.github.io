HTML formatting, CSS, JavaScript plugins, and pictures are lovingly cooked-up by me for you, totally magic-free and labor-intensive.

Credit is due to the following for their helpful inputs (links available in site footer):
* John Bruno, for the headshot
* devicon.fr for the large-font tech icons
* fontawesome for the small-font connect icons
* Github citizen Mike Young for the idea behind the project image hover effect.
